The goal is to make sure that upon clicking the red increment button, a number will be rendered and counted. As well, when clicking the green button, the number is saved. The total count or entries are displayed below the count.

## Our process

Beginning with good file structure and separation of concerns. Creating the HTML, CSS and JavaSCript files. Knowledge on how to create variables and functions in Javascript is needed. Creating a semantic HTML file, minimal CSS to focus on the Javascript. Scrimba helped through the entire repo, if you want to do it as well refer to the link above in the Links.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS3
- Javascript

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba's Website](https://scrimba.com/) - This helped me recap on some basic FlexBox layouts and how to make this web app. A very useful place to go for interactive learning with a clean built in code editor. No, this isn't sponsored.
